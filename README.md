###### My favourite place in the world is Ladakh which is situated in northern part of India.


Ladakh is most famous for breathtaking landscapes, the crystal clear skies, the highest mountain passes, thrilling adventure activities, Buddhist Monasteries and festivals. Ladakh gains a lot of popularity for being the only cold desert in India apart from bordering the Worldâ€™s highest saltwater Lake **Pangong Lake**. Riding up the highest motorable road in the world, **Khardung la** is a dream come true for many. The Hunder sand dunes, frozen river trek and snow leopards all find their only home in Ladakh.
